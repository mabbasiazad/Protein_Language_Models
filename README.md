- Masked Language Modeling: 

[mutation_effect_enzyme](https://github.com/mabbasiazad/Protein_Language_Models/blob/master/mutation_effect_enzyme.ipynb) calculats the mutation score introduced in the paper [Language models enable zero-shot prediction of the effects of mutations on protein function](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.09.450648v2). It ranks the functional impact of mutated sequences compared to the original (wild-type) sequence.

- Sequence Classification

- Residue/Token Classification
